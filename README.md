# Vicky-2-Anime-Mod

For (cc)HFM or GFM, technically can work elsewhere though non-square flags will make them less visible and possibly some problems with differing tags.

Installation: 

HFM version: extract HFM Animega folder (the one inside the folder, which is located together with the .mod file) and the .mod file to common\Victoria 2\mod. If you have More Stuff, you can put the flags folder inside the More Stuff folder to common\Victoria 2\mod\HFM Animega\gfx

GFM version: extract GFM Animega folder (the one inside the folder, which is located together with the .mod file) and the .mod file to common\Victoria 2\mod.

Note:
1. If you wanna use it on HPM or vanilla or anywhere else (if applicable), apply the HFM version there and it should work fine.
2. If you just want either only the anime flags or potraits then you'll need to only move the needed folders (flags folder for the flags, interface folder for the potraits) to your mod directory.
3. Check HMPS github for the HMPS version.


NOTE: in case of anime flags staying when the submod isn't selected on GFM/HFM/elsewhere, delete flags folder on Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria II\GFM\gfx or Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria II\HFM\gfx.
