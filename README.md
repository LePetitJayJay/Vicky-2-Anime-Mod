# Vicky-2-Anime-Mod

v0.1.0

For HFM, technically can work elsewhere though non-square flags will make them less visible and possibly some problems with differing tags.

Installation: Open .rar file and extract flags folder to the directory: common\Victoria 2\mod\HFM\gfx

(possible addition for gfm version in the future)
