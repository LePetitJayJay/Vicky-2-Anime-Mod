# Vicky-2-Anime-Mod

v0.1.0

For HFM, technically can work elsewhere though non-square flags will make them less visible and possibly some problems with differing tags.

Installation: Open .rar file and extract flags folder to the directory: common\Victoria 2\mod\HFM\gfx. If you have More Stuff, you can put the flags folder inside the More Stuff folder to common\Victoria 2\mod\HFM More Stuff\gfx

Note: recommended to have a backup for your flag folder in case you want to revert back to normal flags.

(possible addition for GFM version in the future)
