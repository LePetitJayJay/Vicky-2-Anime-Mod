# Vicky-2-Anime-Mod

v0.1.0

For HFM, technically can work elsewhere though non-square flags will make them less visible and possibly some problems with differing tags.

Installation: Open .rar file and extract flags folder to the directory: common\Victoria 2\mod\HFM\gfx. If you have More Stuff, you can put the flags folder inside the More Stuff folder to common\Victoria 2\mod\HFM More Stuff\gfx

(possible addition for gfm version in the future)
